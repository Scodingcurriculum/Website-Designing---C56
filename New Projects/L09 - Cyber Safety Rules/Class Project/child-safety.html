        <p>Child safety online means making sure kids can explore the internet without running into dangerous situations. Always use the internet in a shared space where a parent or teacher can help if something goes wrong.</p>
        <p>Donâ€™t talk to strangers online, even if they seem friendly. Some people pretend to be kids but are not. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable or asks you to keep secrets, tell a trusted adult right away.</p>
        <p>Use privacy settings on games and websites to control who can contact you. Remember, the internet can be fun and safe when you follow the rules and stay aware.</p>
