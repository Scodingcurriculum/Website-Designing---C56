        <p>Mobile devices like phones and tablets are great for playing games, learning, and talking to friends. But they can also be risky if you’re not careful. Always lock your device with a password or PIN so strangers can’t use it if it gets lost or stolen.</p>
        <p>Be careful about what apps you download. Some apps might not be safe and could take your personal information without you knowing. Always ask a parent or teacher before installing new apps.</p>
        <p>When you’re outside, avoid using your phone in unsafe places, and never share your location with people you don’t know. Mobile safety is about keeping your device—and yourself—protected wherever you go.</p>
