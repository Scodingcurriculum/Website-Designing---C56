        <p>The internet is a fun place to learn, play games, and talk to friends, but it’s also important to know how to stay safe. Cyber safety means making smart choices when you’re online so you don’t get into trouble or share something by mistake.</p>
        <p>Just like you wear a helmet when riding a bike, you need to protect yourself when using the internet. This can include keeping your passwords secret, not clicking on strange links, and only talking to people you know and trust.</p>
        <p>On this website, you will learn easy rules that will help you stay safe while using a computer, tablet, or phone. You’ll find tips about creating strong passwords, keeping your personal information private, and using the internet in a smart way.</p>
        <p>Remember: Think before you click, and if something feels wrong online, tell a trusted adult right away. Staying safe online keeps you and your information protected.</p>
