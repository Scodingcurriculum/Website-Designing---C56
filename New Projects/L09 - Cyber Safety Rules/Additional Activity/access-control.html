        <p>Access control means deciding who can use your accounts, devices, or information. Just like you wouldn’t give your house key to a stranger, you should be careful about who can open your “digital doors.”</p>
        <p>For example, in a game, you might only let your friends join your private server. In school, only teachers can change the marks in your report card. This is because the right people are given permission to do certain things.</p>
        <p>To keep your information safe, use strong passwords, don’t share them with others, and only give permission to people or apps you trust. You can also use settings on websites or devices to decide who can see your photos, posts, or messages.</p>
        <p>Think of access control like being the guard of your own online world—you choose who comes in and who stays out!</p>
