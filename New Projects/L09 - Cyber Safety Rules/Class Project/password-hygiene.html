        <p>Passwords are like the keys to your online accounts. A good password keeps your information safe from people who might try to steal it. Never use easy passwords like “123456” or your name.</p>
        <p>Make your password strong by using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. For example, instead of “sunshine,” you could use “Sun!23Shine.” The stronger the password, the harder it is for someone to guess.</p>
        <p>Don’t share your passwords with friends, and change them often. If you think someone knows your password, change it right away. Remember: a strong password is your first defense online!</p>
